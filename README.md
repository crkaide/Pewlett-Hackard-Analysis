# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The client, Pewlett Hackard, represented by Bobby, wished to assemble a database that could be easily queried for actionable information regarding a large number of ancticipated upcoming retirements, the "silver tsunami."  The first analysis included visualizing connections between the company's existing datasets in an ERD, assembling them into a SQL database, merging, joining, and querying them in pgAdmin, and providing SQL statements applicable to any updated export(s) of the data.  Follow-up work, reported here, includes more organized reporting of the information for use by company administration and department managers, including number of retiring employees by title, as well as a list of employees eligible for a mentorship program meant to brace the company for the mass exit.
